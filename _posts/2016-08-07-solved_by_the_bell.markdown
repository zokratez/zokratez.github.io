I have been working quite a bit to keep up with the Benjamin's, more like the Lincoln's, and I wish I could say that all of a sudden it clicked adn I can now understand. But, no, that"s not the case. It' like im taking baby steps. But last week I was not able to figure out a CSS layout ona lab. I read and read and all of a sudden one concept was enlightenedI took advantage and concentrated onthat one and it was clearer. It was the rotating of an element 90 degrees. It was simple thinging outside the box, it was just a negative sign but it worked. Details, and thinking creatively will move you to new worlds.
