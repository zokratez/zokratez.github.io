  Not one person can create and expose that creation for the benefit of all by him/herself. It's an effort of many. Yet, even after a group of individuals working in unison, and even though only a few individuals seem to get it, the rewards are still for the elitists.
  I love the fact that coding is exactly like a new language. It benefits the individual 100% so the effort is yours and once you learn enough to communicate then you can understand that you still have to learn as a language is a process of never ending. But as any language you are the one that decides what you'd like to do with it. I see many possibilites of learning and working with people that care to solve problems that could enhance and better the next generation. What is that? I don't know but can somehow see my present that he hardships and adapting to them create a better world. Well I better go learn some more as this is a long and exciting time in my life.
