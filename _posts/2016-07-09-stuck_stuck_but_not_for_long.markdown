As time passes, and it passes quite fast, I see how easy it gets to code. Its not easy don't get me wrong, but certain aspects some how click in my brain that I want to do more of it. But, currently having to provide to eat and pay bills makes it so difficult. I make time when I sit in front of the computer and open up learn.co, and as if scheduled something always comes up right when before, during the process of learning. Are the forces of the hidden in fact trying to stop me to not go any furhter? I don't know, and I whatever it is I hope I can look back and understand.
I love coding, when I'm in the middle of it, I love how my self confidence matures to become more like a kid that gets ice cream for the first time and qants nothing else but more of it. I see coding in everything around me, I like the fact that it is a system to pay attention to detail and fix problems, as problems are all around us. Well, I'll stop journaling as I want ot get back in track to coding. I wish I didn't have to eat or sleep so I didn't have to stop even for that.
