Bill Murray is a great actor but the actor was not an actor. If that last sentence seems difficult to understand is because you havent watched the movie Lost in Translation, and you need to. Same thing with an object oriented langauge and its terminology to move forward in understanding. I have not been able to understand fully and thats because I have not been able to start the classes, I am stuck since I can only ask one orvsometimes two questions per day, and as in life there are many questions I would like to ask but its better to go through hell so you can understand from your own experience how to do it. If I knew more I would intorduce you with more care how, but I am limited. Good luck and get Lost in translation.
