   Zeal without Knowledge title supports my philosophy of why I decide to get involved in matters of creativity; for the goods of first intent. Goods of second intent are important but not my priority as there is no axis to "move" the world, they are in fact pretty hollow. Being optimistic is not my forte, being realistic my weakness, and a pessimist I try not to be. but if WW3 were to happen or a catastrophic change in our lifestyle were to happen, or if someone decides to turn off the lights then being a programmer would be of no avail. So that would mean I would not make more money coding nor able to remotely work, etc. I get that, but to think different in a chaos as a coder would give me an opportunity to think outside the box, to love the process, to be passionate about solving problems, and be around people that look for solutions. My fear is lazy and fools in this world, there is too many of them. I hope I am a coder.
      
My opinion means a straw, I know, but even a straw when blown by the wind bends to solve the forces of nature.
